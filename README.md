# 👋 Hi, I’m @SebastianThomas

## 👀 I’m interested in...
-  sports, maths and programming. 
 
In terms of programming, I started with `python`, but soon I discovered `Java` and pretty much everything I could with the German book ["Java ist auch eine Insel" by Christian Ullenboom](https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/java-ist-auch-eine-insel/), which was just released for the Java Version 9. Reading this book and having written quite a few applications in this language (hobby and during interships), I would say this is the language I am most comfortable with. 

Furthermore, I started learning JavaScript in 2018 and began with writing frontend applications. Meanwhile, I have learned the frontend framework [`vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/) and, based on it, [`nuxt.js`](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/), which I have used for several school projects. Among these, there are two projects for my english class ([US Space Industry](https://us-space-industry.sthomas.ch/) and [McLaren Racing: History](https://mclaren-history.sthomas.ch/)), and two projects for computer sciences: [My recipe book](https://kochbuch-sebastian.herokuapp.com/) (do not comment on the colors, I know they are terrible :)) and a web project we had to do in 12th grade, unfortunately, the code is still work-in-progress, so private.. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Java: With the new release cycle of Java, there are always new features coming, and I love exploring what is new. 
- TeX: Started in 2022 by take notes in classes like physics and maths, but not very good at writing `TeX`.
