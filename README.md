# 👋 Hi, I’m @SebastianThomas

## 👀 I’m interested in...
-  sports, maths and programming. 
 
In terms of programming, I started with `python`, but soon I discovered `Java` and pretty much everything I could with the German book ["Java ist auch eine Insel" by Christian Ullenboom](https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/java-ist-auch-eine-insel/), which was just released for the Java Version 9. Reading this book and having written quite a few applications in this language (hobby and during interships), I would say this is the language I am most comfortable with. 

Furthermore, I started learning JavaScript in 2018 and began with writing frontend applications. Meanwhile, I have learned the frontend framework [`vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/) and, based on it, [`nuxt.js`](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/), which I have used for several school projects. Among these, there are two projects for my english class ([US Space Industry](https://us-space-industry.sthomas.ch/) and [McLaren Racing: History](https://mclaren-history.sthomas.ch/)), and two projects for computer sciences: [My recipe book](https://kochbuch-sebastian.herokuapp.com/) (do not comment on the colors, I know they are terrible :)) and a web project we had to do in 12th grade in pairs of two, unfortunately, the code is still work-in-progress, so private.. 
For backend development, I prefer the popular [`express.js`](https://expressjs.com/). 
What DB do I choose? That always depends on the project, and my coworker(s). I have worked with document-oriented [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as well as [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) (and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)) as SQL-based DBs. 

In 2021-2022, I participated in the competitition [F1InSchools](https://www.f1inschools.com/), with my team [ISH Racing](https://ishracing.de). It was great that we could attend at the German Championship in Bremen (May 7th, 2022), where we were awarded the price for the 'Best Newcomer' due to the time and effort we put into our car design (including CFD-analysis and real-life tests), portfolios, presentation and pit display. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Java: With the new release cycle of Java, there are always new features coming, and I love exploring what is new. 
- TeX: Started in 2022 by taking notes in classes like physics and maths, but not very good at writing `TeX`.

You can contact me either on GitHub, or write me an email (kontakt[at]sthomas.ch). Currently, I still manage to avoid the other social media as good as possible.
